## :dart: About ##

I first posted about this on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/comments/k6vv4i/flappybird_on_xbox_360
It was shared to 1 random person who asked for it privately then someone told me it got added to a stealth server homebrew apps store, not sure which, and from there it spread I guess.
I got nothing from it, not even recognition. I wasn't allowed to post the code or XEX on the subreddit, that's why I never made it public.
I did this just for fun and never thought anyone would actually use it until I randomly found the YouTube review and recognized it was my game :D !!!

I later added multiplayer support, not sure if the version that got spread has it, connect a second controller and press A to try it.
